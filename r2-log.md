### R2D2 - July 03, Wednesday, 2024

Today, I learned about `react-bootstrap` plugin on YouTube. Thanks to **AyyazTech** and his [video](https://youtu.be/swxsnF3PXT4) about it. That's why I immediately uninstall `jQuery` and `bootstrap-icons` that I installed yesterday. I installed `react-bootstrap` and `react-icons` too and read some on their documentations. But my worry is that the website won't work or it throws lots of errors because the template I used have bunch of jQuery. I will still try to make it work. The styles are working fine but not the scripts. That's what I will do tomorrow.

### R2D5 - July 5, Friday, 2024

I tried creating an organization again on GitHub but it still didn't work. I thought its gonna send an email to the company email and I have to confirm it but I don't have access to our email and can't contact the one who have access so I tried one of my emails. Still didn't work and no email send. Then it showed an error message. It had problems with ReCapcha so I thought maybe it in the browser. And yes it is, JavaScript!

After I've created an organization, I do what I had to do to deploy the website on vercel but I have to pay because it's a repo from an organization. I tried netlify even though I know it will still not gonna work.

The one I deployed is the repo on my account. ([See post](https://web.facebook.com/tintinsalada/posts/pfbid03Hy2kKpEwdLWS2DqBSzwYNzwfpj9qBYK3ZMqiLV5F9zsZgDFGaxBFoVRGWPJvFb5l))
