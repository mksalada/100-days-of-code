### R2D2 - July 03, Wednesday, 2024

Today, I learned about `react-bootstrap` plugin on YouTube. Thanks to **AyyazTech** and his [video](https://youtu.be/swxsnF3PXT4) about it. That's why I immediately uninstall `jQuery` and `bootstrap-icons` that I installed yesterday. I installed `react-bootstrap` and `react-icons` too and read some on their documentations. But my worry is that the website won't work or it throws lots of errors because the template I used have bunch of jQuery. I will still try to make it work. The styles are working fine but not the scripts. That's what I will do tomorrow.
