### R1D2 - October 07, Thursday, 2021
Today, I didn't do Project 0 because I helped a friend with a project. His project is Discord Navbar clone. He used Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. He requested if I could make it using Bootstrap. It's not that polished and after that I plan to do Project 0 but unfortunately, something came up so I hope that Bootstrap project is valid for my second day of 100DaysOfCode challenge.

I took a course for undestanding CSS Positioning before at Pluralsight. Today, I relearned it for positioning my navigation bar. And my problem is solved now.

I stopped the challenged. I am not proud of it honestly but I have to stopped. Something came up and I got so frustrated that I had to stopped evrything I'm doing. I can't tell the details. I don't know if when I will start over for the challenge.
